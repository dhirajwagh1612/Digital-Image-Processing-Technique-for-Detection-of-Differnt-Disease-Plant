   Agriculture is an ancient occupation. It plays an important role in our day to day life. Food is basic need of all human beings. To distribute food among large population needs proper amount of production. In India large number of population lives in rural areas where livelihood of people depends mostly on agriculture. Thus Indian economy mostly depends on agriculture. Hence increasing quality production has become necessary day by day
   Monitoring of plants/crops and their management from early stage is utmost important. It includes various tasks like preparation of soil, seeding, adding manure and fertilizer, irrigation, disease detection, spraying pesticides, harvesting and storage [1]. Amongst these entire tasks spraying proper amount of pesticides has to be taken proper care. Pesticides are used to attract, seduce and destroy pests hence known as crop protection product. Pesticides are prepared by harmful chemicals or sometimes by biological methods to kill pests, weeds or infections on plants. 
   
  As economy of India is based on agricultural production, utmost care of food production is necessary. Pests like virus, fungus and bacteria causes infection to plants with loss in quality and quantity production. There is large amount of loss of farmer in production. Hence proper care of plants is necessary for same. This paper presents an overview of using image processing methods to detect various plant diseases. Image processing provides more efficient ways to detect diseases caused by fungus, bacteria or virus on plants. Mere observations by eyes to detect diseases are not accurate. Overdose of pesticides causes harmful chronic diseases on human beings as not washed properly. Excess use also damages plants nutrient quality. It results in huge loss of production to farmer. Hence use of image processing techniques to detect and classify diseases in agricultural applications is helpful.

Deployment - The web application will help us to detect diseases on the plant leaf and suggest pesticides for the same.

Future Scope - Mobile application will turn Android phone into a mobile crop doctor with which you can accurately detect pests and diseases on crops within seconds
Our model is trained to detect only 15 types of diseased plant we propose to train system with much more data of various other plants and disease to further increase the scope of system.
The images captured by the user using the system can also be added to dataset, this will lead to better accuracy of the model.
We propose to add section for community of agriculture expert where farmers can ask there doubts and find the solution for the same

Conclusion - Plant diseases are major food threats that should have to overcome before it leads to further loss of entire field. But often framers unable to distinguish between similar symptoms but ace different diseases. Hence we employ CNN to reduce this loss and guide farmers with video lessons. This can be done through mobile app.
